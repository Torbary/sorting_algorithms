## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, We are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

*    At least four different sorting algorithms
*    What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
*    How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
*    What is a stable sorting algorithm
